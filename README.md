# table_flask
This is a simple project which uses Flask along with a few Flask libraries to display JSON (array of dictionaries) files in a neat table!
The file needs to be uploaded and the relevant field-keys must be filled in the form.
On Submitting the response, the table will be displayed with the corresponding entries.<br>
To install,<br>
- install requirements using pip or conda...
- set env variables
- run flask
Cheers, CH.
